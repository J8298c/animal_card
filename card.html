            <p>The White Walkers are a mythological race of humanoid ice creatures, who come from the Far North of Westeros. Believed by many to be legends, they have returned and have been seen by several sworn brothers of the <a href="http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Night's_Watch ">Night's Watch</a> and countless wildlings. While having an overall humanoid appearance, White Walkers differ greatly from humans. They are taller than humans and have long wispy white hair and also commonly a white beard. </p>
